Myrskor are quadrupedal dragons with large earfins.  They are rather agile and not as strongly built as, for instance, [[Vrash]].  They are capable of walking on their hind legs alone for some distance, but not as much as [[Vashael]].

Myrskor live almost exclusively underground, but they have a bright society due to their innate light magic.  They tend to be a little luminous in dark places, and can summon orbs of light by force of will.  A few spots of light on their fins is a common Myrskor spell to create light in darkness, and *virtuosos* show off by practicing patterns of light upon their scales.

The involved rituals to achieve it are somewhat uncomfortable, but most adult Myrskor have permanently bound some of their light magic into a very bright construct that resembles a mirrored shield with a ball of light hanging from it by fine chains.  These are placed over their fields.  In this way, Myrskor lights are used for agriculture, a faculty at which they greatly exceed the Myrghon.  Some wilderness areas in the underground have likewise been given false suns by the Myrskor.
