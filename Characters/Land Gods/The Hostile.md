Hostile land gods are generally considered impossible to negotiate with, or at least impossible in a regular way.  Some of these will interact favorably with heroes despite their antipathy to the public; others will interact favorably with humble people of ordinary backgrounds despite their antipathy to heroes.  Others have not been found to communicate in regular ways.  In any case, as this designation is usually applied by geomancers, hostile land gods are not typically fond of geomancers.

Some 'Hostile' land gods are also 'Missing' - this happens when geomantic magics *have* been observed in the land, but strictly detrimentally to lesser divinities.  People who venture through hostile theomes and survive tend to become disenchanted with the divinity of the ordinary soul in Theoma.
