The land gods are extremely powerful within their domains.  They are limited by custom more than by fiat.  However, they *cannot* leave their domains.  The land gods have a non-local community (think of the internet) and are aware of every other land god on Theoma, but they never lay eyes on any land god who isn't adjacent to them.

Land gods can 'see' through the senses of their avatar, but they can also see wherever they're paying attention in their theome.  They're supreme multitaskers who are typically paying attention to at least a dozen things at any given time.  However, they're not quite omniscient; things can go wrong where the land god isn't paying attention.  Notably, they have difficulty perceiving necromantic enchantments, which can also be used to shroud things they would otherwise perceive straightforwardly.

Some of the land gods have additional impairments.  Boghegd is famously 'blind', meaning that although he can shape the land as a land god, he has only about as much ability to sense the world as a skilled geomancer.  'Blind' land gods are much more dependent on their avatars and have a much larger amount going on in their territories that is not being fate-guided.
