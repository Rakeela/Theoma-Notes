Missing Land Gods rule  territories that have never been seen to have incarnates, which have also never been observed using geomantic magics in defense of any lesser divinity.  Climates resemble earth climate dynamics more strongly within and around missing theomes, because larger weather systems exist in these regions of Theoma.

These theomes are generally lures for necromantic research, since the negative side effects of it are blunted.  However, it's not truly safe, as weather isn't the only fate magic that flows through missing theomes freely.
