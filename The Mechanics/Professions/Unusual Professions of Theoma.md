Theoma has every kid of profession appropriate for the resources and capabilities of each society that it brushes against.  If I document the ways of a potter, it will surely be on the cause that it is relevant to a location or a character.  Yet any intrinsically unusual profession may deserve a page of its own, such as (to start with) the professions of magic.

The currently defined professions of magic are:
1.  [[Geomancer]]
2.  [[Necromancer]]
3.  [[Priest]]
4.  [[Wind Mage]]
