Ilyrra's geography is widely variant.  The southern peninsula is as big as Niazon's entire landmass, and most of it is quite verdant and/or heavily populated.  The northern half of Ilyrra (towards the various hazards of the Deathwall) is quite cold and much more sparsely populated.

---
There are 3090 theomes in Ilyrra.  35% of these are benevolent, 15% are negotiable, 15% are hostile, and 35% are missing, but note that missing theomes in the far north are likely to be (inaccurately) rated in-setting as hostile theomes with unknown land gods.  That means there are 1,082 benevolent theomes, 464 negotiable theomes, 463 hostile theomes, and 1,082 missing theomes in Ilyrra.

These ratios are subject to change.  For instance, I want more unnavigable theomes to make long-distance travel more challenging.  Navigation challenges are negotiable or hostile.

97 down, 2993 to go.  Per the current percentages, there are 1,057 benevolent theomes left to allocate, 437 negotiable, 440 hostile, and 1,067 missing theomes to allocate.  I need a new clustering method to define the allocations.  If I allocate theomes in clusters of 19, I will need to produce ~158 clusters or Ilyrra in particular.  With a few sentences per cluster, this should be doable for the entire map.  I can then dig down to specify more of the map later.

I have a globe on order which I may label with France-sized regions to establish the lay of the land for this.  I will then record the region clusters below.

...it has just occurred to me that I don't like the continents I've allocated with the numbers that I've allocated for them.  The landmass is moderately horrible, but I can still work with it.  The countdown sequence here with the number remaining is what. made me realize just how untenable this is.  So while I'll keep the written and unwritten works here, I'm going to transfer out the undefined ones.

---
I like these continent names, but I might totally reassign them.  Kelkaith can be bigger and put where I've currently got Illyrra.  Ilyrra is going to become an arid highlands kind of place in the big central continent.  It's still the biggest continent, but I've rebalanced them.

		* Land god's name:  Aleiary
		* Alignment:  Hostile (5 left)
	* Sulosa:  The fortress communities here are not militant, but fearful.  The land god does not protect the people, and a great army once tried to conquer the theome in the name of a foreign nation.
		* Land god's name:  Senock
		* Alignment:  Negotiable (2 left)

		* Land god's name:  Athisi
		* Alignment:  Negotiable (1 left)
	* Dopyso:  These jungles are full of rather mundane hazards, but people have terrible luck with them.  Some people think it's a Missing theome with an unfair reputation, but it really is trying to kill people.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Hostile (4 left)
	* Rixem:  This swampy jungle suffers incessant rain and thunderstorms, and as they're right next to it, inflicts its weather on both of the region's missing theomes.
		* Land god's name:  Viyanne
		* Alignment:  Negotiable (0 left)
	* Adyuto:  Famed for being an anti-necromantic theome despite being a missing theome, the truth of its stance is that this swampy, rainy theome is a terrible place to suffer any trace of necromantic rot.
		* Land god's name: Unknown
		* Alignment:  Missing
		* Note:  Next to Rixem
	* Kukiah:  Elevated ground blunts the constant precipitation from Rixem, but turns some of it to snow.  There are mines here that played out long ago without a land god maintaining the reserves, but the quarries seem everlasting as the mountains here are of good stone.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Missing
		* Note:  Next to Rixem
	* Tenadi:  The land god here has a disturbing affection for fungus and cloudy weather.  Some traders say the reputation is unfairly bad and there are rumors of geomancers holding mushroom feasts with the land god, but bizarre fungal maladies kill too many travellers for Tenadi's reputation to be redeemed.
		* Land god's name:  Xelir
		* Alignment:  Hostile (3 left)
	* Aiskeen:  These verdant plains are roamed by animals with a distressing inclination to eat people and great cunning in their hunting.  The land god is believed to be maintaining a nature preserve.
		* Land god's name:  Baten
		* Alignment:  Hostile (2 left)
	* Kolend:  Known as a consumer of geomancers, Kolend is roved by something akin to temporal weather.  People who want to learn an unusual magic struggle to get close without being destroyed by it.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Hostile (1 left)
	* Rozuni:  Lightning crackles across the trees in this forest without setting them alight.  Some of the travellers who've studied it claim that the land god is communicating something or doing something with the trees, but the heavy presence of lightning elementals and related magics is extraordinarily dangerous.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Hostile
	* Nurewa:  This single vast city is hard to cross, but it is the pride of an architecturally-minded land god who does not value natural areas at all.
		* Land god's name:  Runairt
		* Alignment:  Benevolent
* **Entiallo vicinity (18 theomes)**
		* 7 benevolent, 3 negotiable, 3 hostile, 5 missing

		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Missing (4 left)
	* Rerr:  This theome is known for experimenting with dangerous illusion magics.  They are not immediately adjacent to Eliadu, but there's a minor rivalry due to very different attitudes towards light pollution.

		* Alignment:  Missing (3 left)
	* Talais:  The architecture in Talais is generally considered very elegant.
		* Land god's name:  Mawelyna

		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (4 left)
		* Note:  Next to Talais
	* Tialdegar:  A ruined city here speaks of a prior era where conflict arose with the land god, but the cause of the conflict has been forgotten.  People here dwell in prosperity today.
		* Land god's name:  Inaluhine
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (3 left)
	* Oyalerine:  One of the rare necromancy-protective theomes with land gods, there would be no death in Oyalerine were it not for the land god occasionally failing to protect novice necromancers.  (They really can't.)
		* Land god's name:  Iskast
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (2 left)
	* Dizun Alek:  The city of Dizun Alek is regarded with hope and trepidation by people who seek here for the righting of wrongs, as it is famed for its courts.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (1 left)
	* Xetiach:  This relatively barren place is fairly safe for travellers, but not for residents; people are drawn to spend too much time here only when they have tired of life.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Negotiable (2 left)
	* Ormistak:  One of the gentler lightning forests of Ilyrra, there are settlements here protected by the land god... who still won't explain what the forests are for.
		* Land god's name:  Geneyan
		* Alignment:  Negotiable (1 left)
	* Meindre:  Known as the hushed city, the cathedral of uttermost darkness in this city warns all of its curse: it is unlucky to raise your voice anywhere in Meindre.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Negotiable (0 left)
		* Note:  This land god speaks to a few people on condition of anonymity.
	* Marvadan:  Despite being a missing theome, the ground here has proven so metal-rich that it inspired a resilient metallurgical culture.  The docks of Marvadan export a lot of very prosaic worked metal.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Missing (2 left)
	* Lizossasda:  Famed for its underground cities, Lizossasda has many inhabited tunnels.  The "cities" of Lizossasda are individually small, and the population density is not actually very high, but they give a solid impression of being very urban by virtue of surrounding people with artificial walls.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Missing (1 left)
	* Undjask:  A necromantic academy was founded here a long time ago, and developed a reputation that scared away settlers.  The academy has since folded, but a wilderness area has sprung up that drives people off with a mix of awe and superstition.

		* 6 benevolent, 4 negotiable, 1 hostile, 1 missing
		* Southwest of the Ilyrra mega-peninsula (still part of Ilyrra)
	* Etiadray:  Although beautiful and safe, the strange dreams that plague people who spend the night here are best used only for insight.  A few crazy fisherpeople are the only permanent residents.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (5 left)
	* Rurixiti:  Known for its flying judiciary and well-respected querent querent offices.
		* Land god's name:  Ratir
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (4 left)
		* Note:  Many Vashael
	* Aeristiallo:  The good-humored people of the island of Aeristiallo are responsible for a widely-recognized culture
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Benevolent (3 left)
	* Xyrasi:  Known for its unusually dangerous querent querent office, as zealous veteran explorers congregate here to discuss and plan expeditions to distant theomes.  They're not dangerous to visit; they're dangerous to join.
		* Land god's name:  Unknown
		* Alignment:  Missing (0 left)
	* Tyanixira:  This island remains wild forever, as its land god will not tolerate any development.  It's an avian sanctuary.
		* Land god's name:  Aral
		* Alignment:  Hostile (0 left)
		* Note:  Next to Xyrasi
	* Aestyra:  The artist colony here is reluctant to accept new residents, as they are keen to preserve the natural wilderness areas that they love.
		* Land god's name:  Hinarin
		*  Alignment:  Benevolent (2 left)
		*  Note:  Also next to Xyrasi
	*  Akalaghau:  This island bears a sadist beacon, drawing together people of a revolting disposition.  Its reputation is infamous, though its land god claims to love people.  The amount of suffering here would mark it for 'Negotiable' alignment... but the death rate is really quite low.
		*  Land god's name:  Monira
		*  Alignment:  Benevolent (1 left)
		*  Note:  Ick
	*  Avval:  A mission is established here that rescues people from Akalaghau.
		*  Land god's name:  Sondjask
		*  Alignment:  Benevolent (0 left)
		*  Note:  Next to Akalaghau
	*   Aidalis:  This overgrown sanctuary island welcomes visitors for quite a while, but people eventually have dreams that encourage them increasingly forcefully to leave.  Ignoring them is lethal.
		*   Land god's name:  Unknown
		*   Alignment:  Negotiable (3 left)
	*   Tyaedasurin:  There are a cluster of volcanoes here rising up from the sea as the whole of the 'theome'.  There isn't a lot to explore, but geomancers say that the flow of fate suggests there *is* a land god here.
		*   Land god's name:  Unknown
		*   Alignment:  Negotiable (2 left)
	*   Phoeristiru:  A city of intelligent elementals is built up on this island.  Non-elemental residents are allowed, but the energies that flow freely are not good for them.
		*   Land god's name:  Unknown
		*   Alignment:  Negotiable (1 left)
	*   Saedastideu:  The two islands of this theome are overgrown with ports, but they have a bad crime rate.  They stink, too.
		*   Land god's name:  Krakth
		*   Alignment:  Negotiable (0 left)
	*   **Persayo-vicinity (19 theomes)**
			*   0 benevolent, 3 negotiable, 15 hostile, 1 missing
			*   Peninsula base
		*   Vorawk:  This theome twists and distorts productive endeavors, feeding back disastrous luck.  It is littered with ruins.  People are drawn by easy resources and opportunities from the nearby trade route, but they curse Vorawk on the way out if they survive their plans being destroyed by fate.
			*   Land god's name:  Unknown
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (14 left)
		*   Tyskelath:  This theome respects people if they are mourning, but this is enforced too strongly.  The abstracts that roam it make it too dangerous to qualify as a negotiable theome.
			*   Land god's name:  Unknown
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (13 left)
		*   Ensultur:  Known as a city of fine airs, Ensultur is considered a negotiable theome due to the ill health that stalks its citizens.
			*   Land god's name:  Chraultai
			*   Alignment:  Negotiable (2 left)
		*   Undirra:  This theome is a beacon to violent souls, and it's a vicious psychic influence.  People come here to die.  Querent-querent hates it.
			*   Land god's name:  Syaduestiphos
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (12 left)
		*   Morilteney:  The stones underfoot live in this theome, and often move about violently.  Stable paths and temporary structures are never to be trusted here.
			*   Land god's name:  Reiyar
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (11 left)
		*   Ingrisidari:  The trees overgrow everything here.  It is placidly impossible to build in Ingrisidari, and while a few wilderness hermits defy its "hostile" classification, almost nobody lives here, nor can roads be built in it.  The animals here are many and competent.
			*   Land god's name:  Kekaltia
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (10 left)
		*   Ketenth:  This theome attracts envious gazers, but the crystal fields here are not safe to take souvenirs from.  This is however a theome on the trade route, and so they do get taken nonetheless... by fools who get away with it.
			*   Land god's name:  Kyrdas
			*   Alignment:  Negotiable (1 left)
		*   Boskel:  The city-state of Boskel is infamous for its mystic counterpart.  There are two cities overlaid, and woe betide the person who finds the other one.  It is for having unpredictable (and sometimes hard to detect) transitional portals between the two cities that it is considered a negotiable theome.
			*   Land god's name:  Keveldinek
			*   Alignment:  Negotiable (0 left)
		*   Esthatrad:  This eerie 'ruined city' is actually a work of art produced by its land god.  Almost nobody has ever lived here.  Brave geomancers occasionally take the risk of offering critiques to Jaiaton, to increase the verisimilitude of the city.  It's worth doing if he accepts their suggestions.
			*   Land god's name:  Jaiaton
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (9 left)
		*   Zavaraint:  This forest grows in odd patterns.  It's something of a social experiment, and though the land god is openly hostile to settlers and harvesters, the survival rate is pretty high.  The forest is supposed to be eerie in the extreme without resorting to the actively unnatural.  Some of these patterns get replicated in other forests that are trying to create an eerie grove here and there.
			*   Land god's name:  Aleathin
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (8 left)
			*   Note:  Land gods who don't like people living in them are 'a type'.
		*   Sulundas:  Known (and feared) as a sacred forest, it's possible to leave the region through a trail that crosses Sulundas, but ONLY for individuals travelling alone.  Sulundas occasionally greets people who traverse his body.
			*   Land god's name:  Sulundas
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (7 left)
			*   Note:  Next to Zavaraint, and yes, they are friends.
		*   Riafkal:  There are strange constructs upon the surface of Riafkal, but it has a reputation for being demon-infested, and there are rumors of bottomless pits in the theome.
			*   Land god's name:  Jowos
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (6 left)
		*   Zhaetam:  An air of mystery surrounds Zhaetam, because it has such a low survival rate.  Its few escapees claim to have been surrounded by a world of absolute triumph that plied them with everything they ever wanted...  Neekal has met with geomancers at the theome's border to claim to be providing custom paradises, but the fact that people don't return to their loved ones has given Neekal an awful reputation nonetheless.
			*   Land god's name:  Neekal
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (5 left)
			*   Note:  Seen from afar, Zhaetam is just a region of forested hills.
		*   Schaonar:  A road runs through Schaonar promising an easier path, but it's a false promise.  Everything in this theome gets harder the more it's done.  Geomantic constructs that in other theomes are used to make lesser divinities more competent and at ease in filling their roles are used here to fray apart whatever is being done.  Theoretically, Schaonar doesn't kill people; it's just *miserable* to do *anything* here.
			*   Land god's name:  Unknown
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (4 left)
		*   Enduskas:  There's a society in Enduskas, but it's fake.  It's welcoming and offers many opportunities, but the welcome is fake and so are the opportunities.  Every permanent resident here is an abstract.  It's not a good theome to live in.  This place rewards either sloth or restlessness, and in various ways makes people question the value of labor.  Wardell eventually expels people who get trapped for too long... a few centuries.  He'll bust it apart rather than let people meet each other here, too; it WILL stay fake.
			*   Land god's name:  Wardell
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (3 left)
		*   Ryntormoror:  A mountain rises in Ryntormoror, and the difficult terrain invites no crossings.  Those explorers who've made the attempt have reported a spiritual hell that binds them to their own anxieties strongly.  Penitents sometimes come here willingly, but it's a dangerous practice.
			*   Land god's name:   Imet
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (2 left)
		*   Lantchul:  Sometimes called "the city of lanterns", there's no actual city in Lantchul.  It just has interesting "structures" of stone lit by floating lanterns.  It's next to Ryntormoror, and the mountain gives the semblance of falling apart in regular patterns on the Lantchul side of it.  Although the land god seems to have built something meant to be visually appreciated, it is best seen at long distance...
			*   Land god's name:  Tanashia
			*   Alignment: Hostile (1 left)
			*   Note:  Haven't decided what happens to people who venture here.
		*   Taictor:  Sometimes called "Vesat's Folly," this was once an urban theome, but the land god misused fate too much.  Deserted by the public and condemned by querent-querent, people now refer to Taictor wholly as a cautionary tale.
			*   Land god's name:  Vesat
			*   Alignment:  Hostile (0 left)
