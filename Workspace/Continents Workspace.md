There are six continents on Theoma.  I'm not committed to any particular shape of world just yet, and I'd rather delay commitment in this respect.  Currently, I have two 'story clusters'; Praoziu's Nidrio, and Cortacaffakallyenay's Nyberinz.  I either haven't mapped them relative to each other, or I am not attached to their current mapping, though for some reason I have this idea that Nyberinz is well northwest of Nidrio.  These require one continent.

I have a book on how to create worlds (Creating Places by Randy Ellefson) that I'll use for this.  I plan to create six continents on Theoma.  There are 10820 theomes on Theoma, not counting sea theomes (of which there are 6918, most of which are barren missing theomes containing only seas).

The Continents (in descending order of size):
	1.   [[Ilyrra]]
	2.  [[Ormeri]]
	3.  [[Niazon]]
	4.  [[Reytas]]
	5.  [[Kelkaith]]
	6.  [[Kanjamund]]

Note to self: Stagger the sizes of these at exact intervals.  Only people who do the math will notice, and they'll be amused.  An even 1/6th split would yield 1,803

If each share is 515 theomes, then...
6 for Ilirra creates 21 shares (3090 theomes)
5 for Ormeri creates 15 shares  (2575 theomes)
4 for Niazon creates 10 shares  (2060 shares)
3 for Reytas creates 6 shares  (1545)
2 for Kelkaith creates 3 shares  (1030)
1 for Kanjamund creates 1 share  (515)
There are 5 spare shares here, which will be given to Kanjamund, which shall now be 520 theomes in size.

A note on weather:  Weather flows freely over missing theomes.  Land gods can accurately influence weather in their own domain, but they can also inaccurately influence weather in adjoining missing theomes.  I thought of this earlier in this way (imperfectly paraphrased):  "A land god can strike the same point with lightning fifty times in their own domain, but they can only send a lightning storm to a missing theome."  Some missing theomes are nevertheless un-navigable because of bad weather in adjoining theomes.

The far north of Theoma has 'The Deathwall', a place of very obvious hazards.  Not many people in Theoma know that there's a thin band of theomes within and beyond the Deathwall, but adventurers who prepare well for extreme (but comprehensible) hazards can traffic to them.  They're very special places.

The far south of Theoma has 'The Firewall", a place that is only beautiful to people who can appreciate lead-melting heat.  The ocean seethes near it, and hot rain ruins the southernmost theomes.  There are no theomes in The Firewall, but elementals other than those aligned to ice occasionally travel there to join societies of intelligent elementals near the shorelines.

The far south of Theoma also contains "The Embassy", a Fae-run island of apparent perfect beauty.  However, it is a dangerous place with many disappearances, and people who care about safety very much do not visit it.  Land gods warn against it, and Reytas refuses to trust it.  It is off the coast of Reytas, and those who thought otherwise are all long gone.
