There was once a tree in Nidrio which was the favorite tree of Denziu, who was at that time a rather young Vashael, and not yet fully grown.  Denziu saw it many times, and had once even climbed up into its branches, though doing this earned zir a very surprising visit from Praoziu, who appeared levitating out of nowhere to seize Denziu down from the tree by her own hands, claiming that the tree was not strong enough to support a climbing Vashael.  After that, Denziu had several times still sat on a low, stout branch of the tree, which Praoziu said was safe.

It was a rather large tree that had grown up next to the river, just past the field of watergrasses where the seasonal floods of the theome's one river in this area would strike with particular force after heavier rainfalls and rip up more complex, slower-growing vegetation.  Denziu knew this place as a particularly excellent mudpit, where the river's tendency to break its bank also logged the ground, and the loss of the grasses was no great loss to the beauty of an area that occasionally lost them all its own whether or not dragons came tromping through.  So, quite often, the tree overlooked a torn-up mudpit, and occasionally it overlooked several wrestling dragons.
