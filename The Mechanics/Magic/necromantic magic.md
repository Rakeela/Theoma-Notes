Necromantic magic is the basic magic of the lesser divinities, but in-universe, most lesser divinities would deny being necromancers.  Without training, the inborn talent amounts to nothing, and it's arguably better not to train it; most necromancers age, rot, and die!

Necromantic magic is uncertain to geomantic future projections in a way that geomantic magic is not.  This is in-universe often described as "necromancy obscures [[fate]]", "the futures of necromancers are invisible to land gods", and similar claims.

Most land gods dislike necromancers, but a few welcome them.  Most schools of necromantic study are in theomes with 'absent' land gods - which is to say, they have no detectable genius locii.
