Boghegd, also known as 'the Blind Judge', is a rare land god who is almost totally fate-blind.  He controls a mercantile theome on the edge of one of the seas of Theoma.  The flow of fate through his territory (including the weather) is mostly a free-flowing creation of the other land gods who take an interest in it, like the flow of fate in the 'Missing' theomes.

Unusually for a land god, Boghegd cares about personal wealth.  It's possible to outright buy blessings from Boghegd, but that is not where he is trying to make a fortune.  His theome is run like a business and contains a great deal of logistical services (warehouses, ports, & roads) which try to service the surrounding region and the sea trade.  He uses geomantic spells to accelerate construction and repair, and that is essentially his dayjob; the theome has a very limited construction industry as a result.

Although bizarrely avaricious for a land god, he is not bizarrely avaricious in general, and he is known for his sense of fairness.  However, he is the only fate-blind land god among the land gods or those associated with the sea to which his theome immediately connects, and that is why he is known as 'the Blind Judge' rather than 'the Blind Merchant' or 'the Blind Architect'.  It's a very rare trait.  He is not literally blind, but geomancers know better than to ask for his insight into fate, as there are a number of blessings he cannot (or will not) bestow.

It's rumored that there used to be a necromantic academy in Boghegd's theome, but if so it has been shuttered for a long time.
