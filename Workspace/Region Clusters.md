10820 theomes on the wall, take one down, pass it around, 10819 theomes on the wall...  In total, there will be a need for ~570 region clusters.  I've got a globe on order which may induce recalculation of this after I've tiled it with appropriately sized pieces.

Names to use later:  Silasu, Estold, Brousk, Riles, Rothis, Ormash, Tias, Arenth, Lyeltur, Garchin

Names to use (if thematic):  Itat, Keldale, Tyang, Usktang, Uskbana, Tyves, Rynomi

Might split this again into thematic groups.  Such as Usktang and Uskbana, which sound like they're from the same culture.  Note that some of these may be reused for land god names instead of theome names.
