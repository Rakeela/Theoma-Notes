The Vashael are a 3/4ths quadrupedal dragon species which is often seen standing on two legs, with a hunched forward posture and their tail on the ground behind them.  They usually go down to all fours while moving from place to place.  They have broad wings and a basically agile reputation.

Vashael are renowned in-setting for their in-born connection to the geomantic wind, which swirls around them at all times; the air is never quite still around a Vashael.  They are exceptional flyers as well, as their wind magic means that their wings encounter best-case air flows in all but the most turbulent weather.

Vashael exist in many colors and with many combinations of minor features, but they always have earfins, and never other kinds of ears.  Most Vashael have prominent fins in other places as well.

Vashael are famed for settling 'in the clouds', with overtall buildings accessed by concourse balconies in some regions, literally flying cities in others, and improbable architecture holding entire city streets off the ground in a few.  Although ground level connections also exist for most Vashael cities, the amount of stair-climbing involved for groundside visitors varies from moderate (hoisted streets) to appalling (ascending to a flying city).

Looking at the images I commissioned for a few of the Vashael, it looks like they have distinctive earfin configurations.  The number of spars on the earfin may be an identifying variable among dragons, with 2-4 spar fins varying appearances.  This is just as the presence, number, and configuration of horns is an identifying variable by varying appearances.

The more identifying variables the dragons have, the lower the doppelganger rate will go.  Larger variations within the space of beauty permit a higher basic valuation between people, so I should keep trying to identify potential identifying features.

There are some narrative implications of the ear spar detail, as well.  Any Vashael lacking the uppermost spar of their earfins would not be able to hold their earfins in obvious full extension.  This makes them look both calmer and more disengaged than other dragons, which may or may not be an accurate read.
