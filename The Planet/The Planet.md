Theoma is a world where almost everything is part of one or another genius locii spirit, and the genius locii are almost arbitrarily powerful.  Nature and weather are toys for the genius locii, who as land gods dwell in eternal peace with one another, though not always with the 'lesser divinities' who walk through the weave of fate created by the land gods' games.

Most of the continents are undefined at this point, though there are several major land bodies.  I'm presently thinking there will be six continents in all on Theoma, plus potentially landmasses that are not really large enough to be continental in nature, so that there may be further 'continents' for isolated archipelago.
