Some of the land gods seek to be worshipped.  Some of the land gods don't tolerate being worshipped.  No faith centered around a land god is a meta-religion, and very few of them are celebrated outside of the specific theome in which the land god is empowered.  A very few of the land gods have established themselves as immortal philosopher kings; these are the ones who have followings in other theomes, and they are still not meta-religions.

Meta-religions are most distinctly pursued by geomancers, who travel widely and yet must live on their piety.  All of them appeal to at least some land gods; a region may conceivably have a 'pantheon' of land gods whose worship would *collectively* constitute a meta-religion.  However, meta-religions may also be wide-ranging and based on principles/ideologies instead.  In any case, all meta-religions appeal to at least two land gods, and may be studied by people who wish to be pious to the relevant gods, thereby affecting their fate and ability to use geomantic spells.
