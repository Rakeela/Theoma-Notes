Intended to support the development of many diverse kinds of skills, skilltakers are a kind of enchanted crown which can be made with direct collaboration between a geomancer and a land god.  Convincing a land god to make a skilltaker typically involves more than piety and favor-trading; this service is usually performed only for personal friends and/or substantial ambitions.  (Boghegd, one of the most conventionally ambitious of the land gods, has produced over twenty active skilltakers; the *mode* number of skilltakers produced by land gods is two.)

Skilltakers establish a clear mental connection between their wearer and the local land god.  This is considerably more telepathic influence than is ordinarily exerted, and the feedback on the connection distracts the land god.  Although land gods are ordinarily truly supernal multitaskers who cannot be overloaded, maintaining more than three skilltakers is beyond the multitasking ability of most of them, and the strain of being linked to multiple skilltakers leads to potential geomantic anomalies.  The reward of this struggle is a kind of mental record that encapsulates the information about how to use a particular skill.

With some refining, those records go into the construction of a (non-physical) skill-representation object which geomancers can link to other artifacts called Skillchives.  A skillchive is an enchanted crown that enhances its bearer's ability to perform the tasks of the particular skill to which it is linked.  Skillchives do not establish a personal connection to the land god and do not (meaningfully) tax the multitasking ability of the land god.

Land gods describe working with someone wearing a skilltaker as "uncomfortably intimate" and "potentially annoying".  Skilltakers have no headline effect on the fate of their wearer, but due to the personal connection they establish, they have in practice innumerable subtle effects that cannot be summarized.  Activating a skilltaker is something of a personal test of piety and so a minor geomantic act in its own right, though they are typically worn by non-geomancers.

Skilltakers remain active only while the wearer is practicing the relevant skill, and will turn off if the wearer does anything else, or even if they aren't performing well.  A skilltaker worn by someone whose skill repeatedly disappoints the land god will spontaneously turn into a skillchive of its associated skill.  The skilltaker artifact itself is retrieved by the land god when this happens.

Using a skilltaker, performing very well with its associated skill, and exciting the attention of the land god results in a state of very advanced flow.  This happens when the land god is actively thinking about the skill and remodeling the geomantic interface of the skilltaker's wearer to make them better at performing it, *while* they are performing it.

Kinds of skilltaker/skillchive:

Conventional:  Typically associated with "productive" skills.  These are the most commonly prized and most commonly seen of the skillchives, and typically they're produced with the most minimalist 'crowns' (unadorned bands are common).

Creative:  Associated with "artistic" skill.  Creative skillchives *do not work*, but many land gods enjoy trying to create creative skillchives, so it is common and ordinary for the land gods to have created one.  Creative skilltakers are often awarded as prizes for artistic contests.  Each one is unique, so a creative skilltaker won at a contest must be passed on to the next winner if the artist who won it does not win the next artistic event.

Meta:  Associated with no particular skill.  Meta-skillchives are extremely unusual objects which are mostly useful only for training someone to operate a meta-skilltaker.  Meta-skilltakers observe *possible skill-like patterns* and by doing so provide fate research for the land gods.
