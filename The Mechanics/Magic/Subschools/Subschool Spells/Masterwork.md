The 'spell' of Masterwork actually produces a non-enchanted object.  It's the common advanced use of Materialist magic.  The products are typically called "masterworks", which can also refer to any exceptionally crafted good.

Masterwork goods are as durable as their materials permit.  They are not more durable than that, but they are not *less* durable than that.  Materialist mages sometimes like to show off how much more durable an object of an unexpected material can be than people expect it to be.  Ultimately, you can generally make a more durable object out of steel than paper, but an object made out of paper that is as durable as a paper object can be will stand up to a surprising amount of abuse.

The process of making a masterwork is mostly the same as the process of making that good normally, but slower and more strenuous as the Materialist invokes geomantic sense of the object during its creation, and attempts to press the geomantic structure of the object towards their intentions at various points in the process.  The reward for that effort is that the Materialist artisan generally has the luxury of perfect interactions, ie a stone sculptor who is casting a Masterwork will never have the stone split wrong when they strike their chisel.

Materialists start trying to cast Masterwork early in their training, but they don't succeed for quite a while.  The quality of a Masterwork is limited by the geomantic sensitivity of the Materialist and their skill at the kind of craft they are performing.  Unsuccessfully castings are a form of training.

Piety is not a factor in the functioning of Masterwork (it works even if cast by someone disfavored by the local land god), but it does require the *existence* of a land god, and so the spell will not function in Missing theomes.
