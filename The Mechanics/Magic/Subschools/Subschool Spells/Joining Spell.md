Joining spells are a very simple form of materialist magic which adheres objects to each other.  The most basic joining spells work 'by magic', producing an invisible bond for no particular reason.  Such spells are usually considered ugly by most land gods and most materialist mages, and on Theoma a spell that is ugly is a spell that is weak.  For this reason, materialist mages usually try to work the material to produce a natural-seeming (or at least enchantingly beautiful) join.

Conventional joiners (carpenters) sometimes resent materialists for having such an 'easy' way to work materials, but fully natural joins can't be broken by dispelling.  For this reason, materialists who cast joining spells typically study all the conventional means of joining objects, and prefer to cast joining spells to reinforce natural joins rather than as the sole source of binding between objects.  Materialist joiners typically try to get resentful carpenters to teach them carpentry and/or learn materialist geomancy from them.
