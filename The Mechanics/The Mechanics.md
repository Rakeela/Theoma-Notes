One of my intentions in Theoma is that it should have as near to an intact causality as possible.  Intrinsically, the causality of Theoma will not be intact; fantasy worlds are impossible.  Yet within the limits of my time and intellect, I intend to create mechanics which I can use for many stories.

Ideally, I would like to recreate a kind of volunteering low fantasy; a setting which has great wonders, but frequently eschews them.
