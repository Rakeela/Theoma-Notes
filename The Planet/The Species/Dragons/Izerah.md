Izerah are wingless raptor-dragons.  They are obligate bipeds, despite which they have many variations of draconic features, such as ears, fins, horns, and/or tailspades.

Superficially very nonmagical, Izerah are gifted with an innate running magic and a strong, accurate intuition for the limits of their own endurance.  They're sometimes called 'Sun Runners'; it is highly exhausting and unusual for an Izerah to run from sunup to sundown, but a great many of them can do it.  Izerah have good endurance in general, and often use their sense of their own endurance to train hard without injury.  Should they be injured, Izerah seem to be immune to scarring if scar formation would slow their running speed.

The society of the Izerah is less exhausting than might be feared.  They are not uniformly hyperactive and very few of them run compulsively.  They have a wide variety of professions and some Izerah-majority cities.  One side effect of the ease and speed with which Izerah move is that their cities are planned in a somewhat sprawling fashion; despite this, they live more closely together than most dragons save the [[Swaivshon]].

Some believe that Izerah make the best geomancers, because land god avatars tend to dwell in very obscure portions of their own territory, and there is a substantial amount of searching the wilderness involved in geomancy.  Izerah can cover a lot of ground when exploring.  Other people point out that it is impossible to meet a land god avatar without the land god's permission, and so the only thing the Izerah are very good at as geomancers is getting swiftly beyond the limit of the landmarks they know.  Sometimes moving quickly only results in getting lost as fast as possible.
