Fate is the catch-all term for the cumulative effect of every active geomantic contract on Theoma.  Rather than discuss the details of the individual spells that they cast, land gods and geomancers alike tend to talk about adjusting fate.

Land gods can overrule the geomantic spells of lesser divinities at will, limiting the reach and permanency of lesser divine geomancies.  A land god altering the weather in their theome might snap a few lesser divine contracts globally by making some esoteric necessary future state no longer applicable.  Due to this, some geomancers do /not/ talk about adjusting fate with their spells, but prefer to use 'fate' only to describe the cumulative effect of the geomantic contracts created by the land gods themselves, since those are the geomantic contracts that never break with a change in the the weather.

Fate interacts intimately with the [[geomantic interface]] around every lesser divinity.  This biases decisions, though it can't truly overwhelm individual choice.  The greatest restriction on what fate can do to an individual's choices is that it can't *of itself* compel people to stay in a theome, though benevolent land gods may try to use fate to adjust the odds in ways that make people competent where they are.  There are counter-charms against it, for people who would like to be very sure that they are making their own decisions; the greatest and most reliable of these are necromantic.
