I may seriously cut the majority of non-draconic species from this setting.  In turn, I would likely increase the number of dragon variants if I did.

I need to schlep data from my other notes to get all the dragon notes in, but the variants most relevant to Praoziu and Nidrio are the [[Vashael]] and the [[Vrash]].

I should import raptor-dragons.  The Vashael have a little bit of that stance, but not wholly.  I think I'll call them [[Izerah]].

There are also aquatic dragons, known as [[Veserus]].  They live in riverbanks, lakesides, and swamps.  They don't have gills; they do not breathe.

Deep underground, there are other territories with other land gods.  The predominant dragons in those realms are [[Myrghon]] and [[]].  The underground theomes are dangerously hostile to violence, and mystic theomes are ubiquitous.

On the surface, there are also [[Vohntrai]], whose memories stretch back about four hundred years.  They have good memories, to a point.

The Vashael and the Vrash have magical gifts.  If I give each kind of dragon a magical gift...

Vashael:  Wind aura
Vrash:  Earthshaping
Izerah:  Endless running
Veserus:  Water-breathing
Myrghon:  Spindle gems
Swaivshon:  Resistance to elemental geomancy
Vohntrai:  Regeneration, Resurrection, and 'Fading'
