There are occasional 'anomalous' artifacts on Theoma that shouldn't work, and sometimes that just don't work.  They're called dimensional artifacts.  Anything that senses magic will sense a dimensional artifact, but only as something 'weird'.  Positively identifying a dimensional artifact requires the help of the land god.  It can occasionally (but not usually) be accomplished with experimentation.

Like all magic items, these exist only with the permission of the land gods.  Unlike other magic items, they never, ever spontaneously disenchant.  A land god who rejects a dimensional artifact can only send it elsewhere.  They spontaneously teleport very far away if rejected while crossing a theome boundary, reappearing in the theome of (and usually directly in the presence of the avatar of) a land god who accepts that particular dimensional artifact.

Dimensional artifacts come from worlds other than Theoma.  They can in theory do 'anything', but most of them do almost nothing.  The one universal trait of dimensional artifacts is that they resist magic.  They look really bizarre to geomancers by being something that interacts with geomantic substance while not *being* a geomantic substance.

If there is no land god that accepts a particular dimensional artifact in Theoma, it ceases to exist on Theoma.
