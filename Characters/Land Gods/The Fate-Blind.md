Fate-Blind land gods have minimal senses beyond those they provide to their incarnations.  They are few.  They remain very powerful geomancers with extreme capabilities, but they use their magic as lesser divinities use their magic.

Speculations:
	1.  Is this part of the 'end stage' of a land god's lifespan?  They can live forever if they wish to, but if this is a dwindling stage, they may also stabilize at this level if they like living this way.
	2.  Necromantic magic blocks the fate sense of land gods just a little bit.  Does it age them when necromancers cast spells and necromantic items get wielded?  This might be the root of their typical antipathy to necromancy if so.
