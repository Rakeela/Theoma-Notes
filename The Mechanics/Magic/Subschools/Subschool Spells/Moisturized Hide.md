Moisturized hide is a moderately difficult application of wind magic that is often taught to novices as a form of practice spell.  It's a cosmetic/superficial spell targeting one person (who must be willing), who will be wrapped in a wind aura for as long as both the caster and their target remain in place and focused on the spell.

Moisturized hide tries to create 'perfect' skin conditions, wicking away excess dampness and moisturizing dry hide, while sweeping away dust and dead skin cells, even under a layer of fur.  It can't heal breaks in the skin and isn't recommended for use on injured people, though it's good for the health of the skin on individuals with scar tissue and wounds that have already mostly healed.

Despite the name, novices characteristically err on the side of drying out the skin of the person they're helping, though novice wind mages who love damp places will characteristically leave the target too damp instead.  Experienced wind mages are of course a delight with this spell.  It's particularly popular in theomes with very dry climates, though it sees niche use in swampy theomes as well.

Casting moisturized hide on someone generally also sweeps away any perfumes they were wearing.  The wind aura from the spell temporarily neutralizes their scent.  It is not however a replacement for bathing, as anything sticky or stuck-on will not be affected by the wind.

This spell is most popular among [[Swaivshon]] (for whom it eases fur maintenance).  Some Swaivshon know only enough wind magic to cast this spell well, though that also gives them the basics of manipulating breezes.
