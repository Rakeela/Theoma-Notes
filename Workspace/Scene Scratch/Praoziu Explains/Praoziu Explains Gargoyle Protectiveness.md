One day, on an evening that came after a week in which Taltios had said zie wanted to have muscles of stone too many times, Taisach flew into town and returned with a gift for Taltios: a lorebook about gargoyles.  Taisach said that the individuals in the book were *made* of stone!

It was a small book, though ornate; its five pages of beaten brass were bound together with twine, and each bore stamped text and a colorless picture of a different dragon.  The first three were bipeds, while the fourth stood on all fours, and the fifth stood much as a Vashael would, though all five were wingless.  The lettering alongside each picture gave a name and a brief biography.  Each of the five were gargoyles who lived in the theomes around Nidrio; each had done something famed or infamous.

Taltios read without understanding; zie saw only wingless dragons.  The next evening, zie took the book to Praoziu and showed it to her, asking her to tell zir about gargoyles.

Praoziu asked for the book, and flipped through it briefly before crouching down, setting the book down, and taking a single grey rock from the ground.  This she held in her hands, and she poked and prodded at the hard stone as though it were nothing but clay, shaping it into a rough likeness of the first gargoyle from the book.  When she had nearly finished shaping it, she swept her hand over it, and the likeness became a statue with many details and striking green eyes, yet it remained made of grey stone.  "This is what Shyang looks like, true even to his color," she said, naming the first of the five gargoyles in the book and offering the statue to Taltios.

"He has gray scales?" asked Taltios, looking wonderingly at the statue.

"No," said Praoziu.  "He is made of grey stone."

Taltios tried to wiggle the tail of the statue that Praoziu had made, but it was entirely solid.  The stone did not yield to Taltios' touch as it had yielded to Praoziu's.  Zie asked, "Then how does he move?  Does he move?"

Praoziu nodded and said, "He does!  He moves the same way that I shaped that stone, but he reshapes himself... a little bit, at least.  In the ways that he's accustomed to."  She gestured at the statue of Shyang, and it swayed its tail back and forth.  Taltios yeeped and giggled, clutching the statue upside down and watching its tail move until Praoziu stopped moving it.

When it stopped, Taltios looked up at Praoziu.  "What are gargoyles like?"

"Did you notice anything from the stories in the book?" Praoziu asked.

Taltios set the statue down, and picked the book up instead.  Zie looked at the page on Shyang, who was depicted with a heavy axe across his back.  "Well, this says that he's a firefighter, who rescues people when buildings catch on fire."  Taltios peered past the edge of the book, at the statue.  "Is that safe for him because he's made of stone?"

"It is," said Praoziu, who had read the whole book at a glance, as there was really very little of it.  "Tell me about the next one."

The next page belonged to the gargoyle who looked like a Vashael without wings.  She was depicted with some kind of stout bands around her hands and her feet.  Taltios read the text next to the image, and looked up at Praoziu to say, "Her name is Dynzia.  She's an inspector who searches the riverbeds for dangerous secrets.  What kind of dangerous secrets are in the rivers, mom?"

Praoziu thought about that for a surprisingly long time, and then said, "I don't know.  There are no dangerous secrets in the valley river of Nidrio."

Taltios' jaw dropped; the little dragon was shocked.  "You don't know?  But you know everything!"

Praoziu swept a hand out towards the landscape and said, "Well, I know everything *in Nidrio*.  There is a whole world out there beyond my border, and I cannot see all of it from here.  I do know many things of elsewhere, but not every secret in every land."  She crouched low, and took a step forward, as though to look at the page of the book while Taltios was holding it.  "If there are dangerous secrets in the rivers of other theomes, perhaps you will have to find Dynzia to ask about them."

"Will I ever meet her?" Taltios asked.

"I don't know that either," said Praoziu, smiling.  "Tell me about the next one."

Taltios flipped the page again.  This was another biped, and this one was depicted in very ordinary clothing.  He looked up from the book.  "...Her name is Tawny.  Is that really a name?  Isn't tawny a color?"

Praoziu burst into giggles!  She clasped her hand to her muzzle, stiffling giggles.  "Yes!  It's the color of your father!  *Taisach* has tawny scales," said Praoziu, settling back into a seated position before Taltios.  "And yes, it's also a name.  Some people have such names.  What is she known for?"

Taltios looked at the book again.  "She runs a foster house.  This says she's raised four *dozen* children... over a reeeeally long span of time.  Can people be famous for that?"

"They can.  You, Denziu, and Aleicree, will all someday go out into the world with stories of your childhood," said Praoziu.  "Those will also be stories of me.  There are four *dozen* people telling such stories of Tawny."

Taltios frowned at the book, looking between the picture of Tawny and Praoziu.  Whatever zir thoughts were, zie kept them to zirself, and after a moment zie flipped to the next page.  This was another biped, and this one was depicted wearing a fine robe, a matching hat, and a patterned belt, though the pattern did not show well in the brass image.  "This is Zeiki," Taltios said, "who was once a criminal, until he betrayed his peers by rescuing a young Vashael named Krateia, 'whose story is told in other books'.  What did Krateia do?"

"Krateia is a geomancer who has gotten into trouble many times, and out of it just as many times so far.  I have met zir here in Nidrio," said Praoziu.

Taltios' crest and earfins perked up.  "Really?  What's zie like?"

Here Praoziu put a hand to her chin thoughtfully before saying, "Hm, well..  Zie's very quiet, but inquisitive, and prone to investigating unusual things without preparation.  There is so much of Fate around Krateia, that I almost felt I knew zir history before we spoke; I knew that Krateia had gained the blessings of several land gods before zie even thought to become a geomancer."

Taltios asked, "What would have happened if Zeiki had not rescued Krateia?"

Praoziu shook her head.  "I do not know," she said, but in a disquieted voice.  "Terrible things.  I assume zie would never have become a geomancer."

Taltios looked at the book again, and traced the line of Zeiki's belt with a claw.  "Why did Zeiki rescue Krateia?"

"Zeiki did that because he is a gargoyle, and even criminal gargoyles cannot do certain things.  Have you noticed anything in common between these stories?" asked Praoziu, her orange eyes avid as she watched Taltios' expression closely.

Taltios flipped to the last page of the book and the fifth gargoyle that it depicted.  The form of a quadrupedal dragon had been carefully struck into the brass page, blindfolded and draped in prayer scrolls.  "This one... is Inauk," Taltios said, "Who is a geomancer zirself, and who is famed for giving away the enchanted scrolls of protection and healing that zie wears."

Taltios looked up at Praoziu, meeting her gaze.  "They're a firefighter, a riversearcher, a mom, and, um...  A betrayer of criminals?"  Taltios looked aside, then down, crestfallen.  "I don't see it.  Nothing is common between them except they're all gargoyles.  Even the last one is different again, a geomancer."

Praoziu swept around and hugged Taltios, bringing her head close until their horns tapped and Praoziu's ear touched Taltios' earfin.  "Gargoyles are protective," she said.  "All of them.  They are not all honest or good, but there are limits to how bad they can be, and to what ways they can be bad."

Taltios lifted zir head then, and hugged back on Praoziu.  "Why are they protective?" zie asked.

Praoziu nuzzled on Taltios, lingering in the hug, but Taltios let go, expecting an answer to zir question.  So Praoziu slipped away.  Picking up the statue of Shyang, she held it up between the two of them.  "This... is made of *me*," she said.  "This statue.  It's part of my body, like very nearly everything in Nidrio that isn't a lesser divinity.  When gargoyles are made, they're made from a lesser divinity like yourself, plus a little piece of a land god.  I believe they inherit the protectiveness that land gods feel for lesser deities."

"You believe?" asked Taltios, quizzically.  Zie held zir hand out for the statue.

"I believe!" said Praoziu, handing the statue back.  "I'm not sure.  I cannot make a gargoyle.  I could make a stone elemental that pretends to be one, but I cannot make a real one."

"A little piece of a land god..." said Taltios, wondering, and then after a moment zie frowned at the statue.  "Are gargoyles really that small?"

Praoziu laughed and shook her head.  "No, no, not like this."  She swept back, and then leapt away to alight upon a boulder a little distance away.  She leapt, and it was like she flew; Taltios had strong legs and yet could not have made the same leap without catching the wind in zir wings.  When Taltios had run to catch up and was approaching the boulder, Praoziu said, "Maybe a big piece of a land god!  This stone here would be enough from which to carve a gargoyle."  She whacked the boulder under her twice with her tail.

"Mom, has anyone ever made a gargoyle from part of you?" Taltios asked, looking up at Praoziu atop the stone.

"No.  Not yet.  Maybe someday.  If you ever meet a sacred necromancer, you may tell them I would like it."

Which of course lead to questions about what sacred necromancers were, but it was getting late, and Praoziu said she would explain that some other time; for now they should go home, where Aleicree, Denziu, and Taisach would be waiting for them.
