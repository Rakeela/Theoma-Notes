Technical Geomancers are not usually referred to as geomancers, and they trade on their piety far less.  Where 'general' geomancers are lawyer-priests, technical geomancers generally eschew direct negotiation with the land gods in favor of deeper study against specific aspects of geomantic reality.

Wind mages:  Sometimes referred to as weather mages, wind mages are most prized by sailing vessels, and are most stereotypically [[Vashael]] (who have an instinctive advantage in learning this magic).  Wind magic requires substantial patience to 'gather the wind'.  They often have an ethereal (or just spaced out) attitude, but they are still typically 'professional' mages who sell their skill for currency.

Materialists:  Studying the 'physical' structure and properties of the substance of which the land is made, materialists are rarely 'pure' mages, but are typically artisans who've learned materialist magics to improve their craft.  Materialist mages are not known for piously negotiating with land gods, and most of their spells work just fine whether or not the local land god likes them.

Beastmaster:  As most animals in Theoma are only geomantic constructs, there exist geomantic spells that manipulate them.  As some land gods and good swathes of Theoma's society frown on doing that, specializing in manipulating animals makes a geomancer disreputable.  As disreputable people whose magic helps them excel at survivalism, such geomancers stereotypically live rough.  The life expectancy of a beastmaster is considerably reduced from the average on Theoma, but some people really want to live this way, risks and all.  They show up in heroic stories sometimes.
