Rings of Vanity are a kind of "dark magic".  Their effects are fairly subtle, but they encourage superficial good health and improve the individual's scent.  Short-term, they promote charisma.  Long-term, they're associated with poor luck (negative distortion of fate).

The land gods say that, as geomantic constructs, rings of vanity annoy them slightly, as they exist on the very edge of necromancy and geomancy.  A few of the more necromancy-friendly land gods say that they wish necromancers would produce rings of vanity, as the long-term fate distortions only arise from geomantic rings of vanity, and a necromantic ring of vanity would be "pure".  Unfortunately, it's considerably easier to make a geomantic ring of vanity; the necromantic equivalent requires as much loving care as using entropic energy to *heal* someone.
