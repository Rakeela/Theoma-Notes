Auto-Optimizing Blessings make the object that bears this enchantment get better at whatever it is used for, as long as it is being used willfully and deliberately.  The object's properties adjust gradually to work better in the role its being used for.  This also prevents most degradation from use, though using an object in a way that damages it *rapidly* will overpower the intrinsic repair capacity of its auto-optimizing blessing.

In theory, auto-optimizing blessings have the same risk of spontaneous failure as all other magic items which are brought across the boundary of one theome into another.  In practice, most of the land gods appreciate these blessings quite a bit, and they almost never break while crossing from one theome to another.  This means that auto-optimizing magic items sometimes show up very, very far from the theome where they were made.

Auto-Optimizing Blessings are a rare advanced application of materialist magic.  See: [[Technical Subschools of Geomancy]].
