A priest is a [[geomancer]] who is only associated with one particular land god, or occasionally who is only associated with one particular land god plus a few other land gods who their particular land god is very close to.

Being a priest is safer than being a geomancer.  It's also considerably more sedentary, as most priests are personal friends of the land god who runs their theomes, and do not go trekking across the world trying to meet powerful, dangerous beings to beg power off of them.

For various reasons, priests sometimes resign their allegiance to one land god and become geomancers.
