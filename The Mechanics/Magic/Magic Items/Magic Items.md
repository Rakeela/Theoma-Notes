A lot of magic is via magic items.  Geomancers can in theory try to do anything, but in practice can do very little quickly.  An unprepared instant spell amounts to a prayer for divine intervention.  Anyone can try this.  It doesn't usually work.  Very talented geomancers are more likely to pull this off only because they can specify the geomantic construct they're requesting, so the land god has to put less work into it if they want to say 'yes'.  Necromancers do more of their work spontaneously (as necromantic spells are not prayers and cannot be spontaneously rejected by a land god), but a lot of creativity has gone into necromantic magic items as well, especially among people who are trying to evade or distort fate in some way.

Even when a geomancer is famed for making heavy use of a specific spell, those spells are often powered by their possession of a trinket gifted to them from a land god.  Note that a particular trinket may be enchanted in such a way as to *only* enable a particular geomancer to cast a spell.

Magic items are stabler means of acquiring magical abilities than prayer.  The land gods may reject any particular instant spell from a geomancer, but to reject the use of an authorized magic item they have to disenchant it.  This is a more invasive and controversial action.
