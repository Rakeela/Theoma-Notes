I'm not sure what non-draconic species to use on Theoma, but I'm very attracted to gryphons and crows for this purpose.  I think I want some kind of avians to be part of the setting, as in my prior notes, though I need to start over on the particular choices.  I think they need some kind of gift as the dragons have, and I'm not sure what to give them.
