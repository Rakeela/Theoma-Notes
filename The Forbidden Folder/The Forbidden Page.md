...okay, seriously.  My buzz is permanently harshed by the awareness that I have no privacy, and my privacy was destroyed because I was supposedly a sexual predator.  This annoys me because I still feel obligated to work out some kind of positive, affectionate sexuality.  I still think I /will/ need it if I'm to live forever, and moreover other people need it.

Part of Theoma's appeal is that it intrinsically moves beyond the abused child fecundity which Earth's conservatives are stuck in a position of simultaneously promoting and decrying, because natalism doesn't function without child abuse and natalists hate child abusers.  None of that applies to Theoma.  The whole dreadful tangle is subsumed in one wonderfully complete application of ontogenic control.

There are no malign evolutionary inclinations, either; whatever of such may exist on Earth, it does not function on Theoma.  The psychological crime of rape exists in Theoma, but the reproductive crime of rape does not.  Reproductive success has never been among the special advantages of warriors on Theoma.  Indeed, warriors are less common on Theoma, because the land gods are artists who work in the mediums of landscape painting and/or city planning, and should any of them want to build a battlefield landscape they /don't/ need people to die for the cause.  Malign evolutionary inclinations are missing in the microbial lifeforms of the setting as well; if there were no land gods crazy enough to make atelier diseases, there would be no diseases in the setting at all.  A few of the land gods believe that disease might somehow have some value in society (specifically in fate-crafting) and every land god at least dabbles in soil microbiology, but every microbe on the planet fares poorly when spreading beyond the borders of the particular theomes where microbes of its kind are being crafted or deployed.

This IS a setting that exists in part to help make sexuality thought work for me.  It is a cleaner, safer setting with less violence and universal sterility.  If I believed in my privacy more, I wouldn't have had to write such an investment in apologetics, but I am not given the liberty that I have granted others.  These apologetics can also serve as a good point to remind myself that the "liberal" people who violated my rights were not wrong to point out that my obedience to "liberal" sexual abusers had all the romance of 'a deranged mink in heat', though they were sociopathically incorrect to think that I enjoyed it myself given how much engaging with people like that had been ruining me emotionally.  Yet still, for having been treated in that way, I do indeed not have much sense of romance, and I should be hesitant to write too much in these files lest it ruin the material to me.

Without further ado...

PS.  Some of these are dumb (Vashael Scent Competitions is dumb from the first three).  I'm not really likely to use them, but I thought of them, so I'm publishing them anyways.  The mindrapist set thinks it's evil to even think about this stuff, but maybe that's why evil proliferates in conservative cultures that believe too strongly in the power of conservative angels who are attracted to human mates.
