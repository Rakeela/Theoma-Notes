The Varsh are strong four-legged dragons with earth and fire magic.  They are the most straightforwardly 'western' dragons on Theoma, although their habitually attired society interferes somewhat with that presentation.

They have a limited ability to alter the ground under their feet by force of will.  As a result of this, Varsh do not generally do not sink into the ground, and paths which Vrash have walked on many times are surprisingly hard and durable.  Burrowing Varsh use the same faculty to soften the soil instead; farming Vrash get their noses into the dirt and start altering it in more sophisticated ways.  In any case, any significant use of this ability is tiring; walking on an almost-good-enough path is trivial, but if they were to try to harden a mud field, they would likely cross about two meters before getting exhausted and starting to sink into it.

Vrash farmers are known for breaking and reforming stony soils to make good earth out of them.  In general, the Vrash are known for setting up in stony areas; they are also known for mining and metal working.  Although Vrash miners use magic to break up the stone as they work it, by no means does this mean that they aren't also doing grueling physical labor.

Most Vrash wear armor, either as attire or as physical training weight.  Unburdened Varsh sometimes feel 'too light'; they're faster naked, but many Vrash even sleep in their armor.  Nudity among Vrash is unusual for anything save sporting events and bathing, which can lead to non-Vrash who've never seen a Vrash out of armor describing them as 'metal dragons'.

Attentive study will occasionally reveal that Vrash armor cleans and repairs itself over time.  Regenerative attire is a trait of the Vrash, not their armor.  It's also an imperfect faculty; eventually, both the armor and the dragon will need a more attentive cleaning!
