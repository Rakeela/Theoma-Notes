Swaivshon are quadrupedal furred dragons most associated with arctic climates.  The innate magic of Swaivshon is that they drain the force from elemental geomancy directed at them.  This applies to 'natural' geomancy as well, and so Swaivshon rarely get burns or frostbite, and even the wind won't push them off course.  They are not immune to the hazards that they resist, but they are always 'lucky' when facing them.

Swaivshon are the most likely of dragons to be utterly pacifistic.  They are known for their strong need-for-touch and inclination to gather together in surprisingly dense settlements.  They almost never live in 1s, 2s, or 3s, and so the smallest typical Swaivshon households involve four dragons, all of whom are in a close affectionate relationship with each other.  Since each member of such a household also typically has friends outside of it, Swaivshon social events get large fast.

Swaivshon communities are known for their massive integrated architectural projects.  A small Swaivshon settlement may be a single mansion complex shared by all the Swaivshon in the settlement; Swaivshon cities are sometimes dominated by clusters of such structures with shared services between them.
