Stasis spells are a basic common form of materialist magic which reinforces the current structure of an object.  These spells weaken quickly and should be reapplied weekly for complete effectiveness, though a neglected stasis spell will observably slow entropic influences for a long time.  They're rarely subject to technical disenchantment, and as long as they are not fully removed from an object, having ever applied a stasis spell to an object creates a permanent geomantic record of the form that it was enchanted to retain.

The civilian governments of most hospitable theomes ban the practice of using stasis spells to make an object appear more durable than it really is, as such is considered a form of scamming.

A more lawful and widely appreciated application of stasis spells is that ice merchants use stasis spells to ship blocks of ice all across Theoma.  This is the only way to get ice in many ever-warm theomes, at least without much more dramatic enchantments.
