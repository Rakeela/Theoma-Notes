Semi-durable enchantments that people may or may not want to keep forever are typically imbued upon brittle ceramics.  These may take the form of tubes, statues, or miniature pottery, and are always either thin or hollow.  This is common for adjustments to personal fate which are likely to modify the personal choices of the person whose fate has been adjusted.  Shattering a ceramic object is a cathartic way to reject an unwanted fate influence.

Cursed objects typically follow this rule as well.  It's unlucky in many theomes to trade in 'bad magics', and curses which can be dramatically shattered when they're discovered are less likely to get spontaneously disenchanted by the local land god.  It produces a more satisfying experience.
